# Homework 1: Critical Sections. Locks, Barriers, and Condition Variables

## Objectives

You learn how

	to solve the critical section problem, i.e. to access shared variables with mutual exclusion;
	to program condition synchronization (waiting for conditions) using condition variables;
	to build a concurrent (parallel) program of multiple threads with shared variables, namely
	to create and join concurrent threads and pass input parameters and results;
	to synchronize threads with locks, barriers and condition variables,
	to compile and run a concurrent program using Pthreads (or Java threads and concurrent utilities)
